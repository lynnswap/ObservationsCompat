# ObservationBridge

ObservationBridge helps non-SwiftUI code consume `@Observable` state changes.

It provides:

- owner-bound callbacks through `ObservationScope`
- `AsyncSequence` streams through `ObservationBridge` / `makeObservationBridgeStream`

## Requirements

- Swift 6.2
- iOS 18+
- macOS 15+

## Owner-Bound Observation

Use `ObservationScope` as the lifecycle owner for UIKit/AppKit views, view
controllers, cells, or other non-SwiftUI objects that render observable state.

```swift
import ObservationBridge

let observations = ObservationScope()

observations.observe(model) { event, model in
    if event.kind == .initial {
        installViewsIfNeeded()
    }

    titleLabel.text = model.title
    countLabel.text = "\(model.count)"
    saveButton.isEnabled = model.canSave
}
```

The callback body is the tracking body. Every observable property read from
`model` inside the callback becomes part of the observation.

### Events

`ObservationEvent.kind` describes why the callback is running:

- `.initial`: the first tracking pass
- `.didSet`: a later pass after observed state changed

`ObservationOptions` controls which later events are delivered:

observations.observe(model, options: .didSet) { event, model in
    render(model)
}

observations.observe(model, options: []) { event, model in
    renderOnce(model)
}
```

`[]` delivers only `.initial`. `.didSet` delivers `.initial` plus subsequent
change-triggered passes. `.willSet` is intentionally unavailable until the
native Swift 6.4 backend can provide accurate about-to-change timing.

Call `event.cancel()` to stop the current observation, or `cancelAll()` to tear
down every observation owned by the scope:

```swift
observations.cancelAll()
```

`ObservationEvent.matches(_:)` is intentionally unavailable before the Swift 6.4
native backend because the changed key path is not exposed by the older public
Observation API.

## AsyncSequence Style

Use `ObservationBridge` when async backpressure, iteration, or rate limiting is
the natural fit.

```swift
let stream = ObservationBridge {
    model.count
}

for await value in stream {
    print(value)
}
```

`makeObservationBridgeStream` is equivalent:

```swift
let stream = makeObservationBridgeStream {
    model.count
}
```

### Stream Options

`ObservationStreamOptions` configures backend selection and rate limiting for
stream observations.

```swift
let debounce = ObservationDebounce(interval: .milliseconds(250))

let stream = ObservationBridge(
    options: .rateLimit(.debounce(debounce))
) {
    model.count
}
```

Available stream configuration:

- `ObservationStreamOptions(rateLimit:backend:)`
- `.rateLimit(ObservationRateLimit)`
- `.legacyBackend` on iOS 26.0+ / macOS 26.0+
- `ObservationDebounce(interval:tolerance:mode:)`
- `ObservationThrottle(interval:mode:)`

Backend notes:

- automatic stream observations use native `Observations` on iOS/macOS 26.0+
- older OS versions fall back to legacy `withObservationTracking`
- `.legacyBackend` forces the legacy backend on iOS/macOS 26.0+
- non-`Sendable` stream values use the legacy backend

## Migration

### v0.9.0

These notes apply when upgrading from `v0.8.x` or earlier to `v0.9.0`.

- Owner-bound observation now starts from `ObservationScope`. Replace
  `model.observe(...).store(in: observations)` with
  `observations.observe(model) { event, model in ... }`.
- The callback body is now the tracking body. Read every observed property from
  `model` inside the callback instead of passing key paths to `observe`.
- `ObservationRegistration` and `.store(in:)` have been removed without a
  compatibility shim.

```swift
model.observe(\.count) { value in
    countLabel.text = "\(value)"
}
.store(in: observations)
```

After:

```swift
observations.observe(model) { _, model in
    countLabel.text = "\(model.count)"
}
```

- `observeTask` has been removed without a compatibility shim. For simple
  fire-and-forget work, start a `Task` from `observe` after copying the values
  you need.

```swift
observations.observe(model) { _, model in
    let count = model.count
    Task {
        await analytics.trackCount(count)
    }
}
```

- If ordering, cancellation, or backpressure matter, use `ObservationBridge` or
  `makeObservationBridgeStream` instead of recreating the old `observeTask`
  queueing behavior.
- `id:`, `ObservationScope.update(_:)`, and `ObservationScope.cancel(id:)` have
  been removed. Use one `ObservationScope` per lifecycle owner and call
  `cancelAll()` before rebinding a dynamic set of observations.
- `ObservationOptions` is now an owner-bound event option set. Use `.didSet` for
  initial + subsequent callbacks, or `[]` for initial-only callbacks.
- `ObservationEvent.matches(_:)` is not exposed on Swift 6.3 and earlier. It is
  reserved for the Swift 6.4 native backend where stdlib exposes matching.
- Stream rate-limit and backend settings moved from `ObservationOptions` to
  `ObservationStreamOptions`.
